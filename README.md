Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust object detection and image annotation system. The system will be capable of identifying and labeling objects within images accurately.
It is designed to enhance applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and image search engines by providing precise object localization and classification.

Problem Understanding
Each project starts with a clearly defined problem. For this project, the problem is to develop an object detection model with a target accuracy of at least 90% on a test dataset. 
This definition helps establish a starting point and allows tracking the impact of any changes made to the model.

Data Collection
The success of the model heavily depends on the quality and quantity of data collected. Collecting a diverse set of images across various conditions is crucial. 
The goal is to gather as many relevant samples as possible to ensure the model learns effectively.

Data Preparation
Data preparation, or data wrangling, is a critical step involving cleaning, resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the dataset. 
This step ensures the data quality is high, directly impacting the model's performance. It is time-consuming but essential for creating a reliable dataset for training.

Data Annotation
In supervised learning, every sample in the dataset needs a label. Data annotation involves tagging images with bounding boxes and class labels, making them suitable for training the object detection model.
This process is crucial for training the model to recognize and classify objects accurately.

Modeling
Modeling involves training the object detection algorithm using the prepared dataset. Evaluation is conducted on a separate validation dataset to ensure the modelâ€™s generalization capability,
avoiding bias and overfitting. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to optimize model performance.

Model Deployment
Once the model is trained and validated, it is deployed into a production environment. Deployment includes setting up infrastructure, integrating APIs, 
and ensuring the model can handle real-time image data with high accuracy. Continuous monitoring is essential to maintain model performance and reliability.
